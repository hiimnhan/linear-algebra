  abstract = {I try to intuitively visualize some important concepts introduced in “Linear Algebra for Everyone”,1 which include Column-Row (CR), Gaussian Elimination (LU ), Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (QR), Eigenvalues and Diagonalization (QΛQT), and Singular Value Decomposition (U ΣV T). This paper aims at promoting the understanding of vector/matrix calculations and algorithms from the perspective of matrix factorization.
